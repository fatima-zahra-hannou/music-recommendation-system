**Music Recommendation System**
This project is a music recommendation system designed to provide users with personalized song suggestions based on a song of their choice. Using a content-based filtering approach, the system analyzes the intrinsic characteristics of a song to find others that are similar, offering an effective alternative to manual searching.
The project integrates data from a Kaggle dataset and the Spotify Web API to ensure broad track coverage. The user interface is built with the Flask framework, enabling simple and intuitive interaction.
